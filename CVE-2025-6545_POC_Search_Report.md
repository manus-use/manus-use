**Medium Risk** - Despite no public POC:
- Vulnerability is confirmed and documented
- Affects widely-used cryptographic library
- Medium CVSS score (4.0) indicates moderate impact
- Signature spoofing capability is concerning

### Risk Factors
1. **No Public POC:** Reduces immediate exploitation risk
2. **Recent Disclosure:** May indicate responsible disclosure in progress
3. **Specific Component:** Limited to lib/to-buffer.js functionality
4. **Version Range:** Clear vulnerable version identification available

### Mitigation Priority
**Recommended Action:** Update to pbkdf2 version 3.1.3 or later
- **Timeline:** Immediate for critical systems
- **Testing:** Verify application compatibility post-update
- **Monitoring:** Implement logging for pbkdf2-related operations
