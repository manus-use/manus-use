# manus-use - Test Summary

## Overview
manus-use is a powerful framework for building AI agents with comprehensive tool support. The project is currently working with AWS Bedrock using the Claude Opus 4 model.

## Test Results

### ✅ Successful Tests

1. **Basic Agent Functionality**
   - Simple queries work correctly
   - Agent responds with appropriate answers
   - Example: "What is 2 + 2?" → "4"

2. **File Operations**
   - File writing works correctly
   - Files are created with specified content
   - File reading capabilities are functional

3. **Code Execution**
   - Python code execution works (using Docker sandbox)
   - Output and error handling are functional
   - Exit codes are properly returned

4. **Web Search**
   - DuckDuckGo search integration works correctly
   - Search results include title, URL, and snippet
   - Agent can search and summarize results
   - Example: Search for "AWS Bedrock Claude" returns relevant information

5. **AWS Bedrock Integration**
   - Successfully connected to AWS Bedrock
   - Using model: `us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-20250514-v1:0`
   - Proper authentication and region configuration

## Configuration

The project uses the following configuration (`config/config.bedrock.toml`):

```toml
[llm]
provider = "bedrock"
model = "us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-20250514-v1:0"
temperature = 0.0
max_tokens = 4096

[sandbox]
enabled = false  # Set to true for Docker sandbox

[tools]
enabled = ["file_operations", "code_execute", "web_search"]
```

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Unified Agent Architecture**
   - Base agent class with Strands SDK integration
   - Multiple specialized agents (Manus, Browser, DataAnalysis, MCP)
   
2. **Tool System**
   - File operations (read, write, list, delete, move)
   - Code execution with optional Docker sandbox
   - Web search capabilities
   
3. **Configuration Management**
   - TOML-based configuration
   - Support for multiple LLM providers (currently Bedrock implemented)
   
4. **Multi-Agent Flows**
   - Flow orchestrator for complex workflows
   - Planning agent for task decomposition

## Known Issues

1. **Async Tool Warning**: The code_execute tool shows a warning about coroutine not being awaited. This doesn't affect functionality but could be improved.

2. **Limited Model Support**: Currently only AWS Bedrock is available in the installed Strands SDK version. Other providers (OpenAI, Anthropic direct, Ollama) need to be added when available.

3. **Long Running Tasks**: Complex tasks may timeout with the default 2-minute limit. Consider increasing timeout for production use.

## Next Steps

1. **Install Optional Models**: When available, add support for other model providers
2. **Enhanced Tools**: Add browser automation, data visualization tools
3. **Production Deployment**: Set up proper error handling and logging
4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive user documentation

## Running Tests

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run simple test
python test_simple.py

# Run full test suite (may timeout on complex tasks)
python test_bedrock_full.py

# Run demo
python demo_bedrock.py
```

## Conclusion

manus-use provides a comprehensive framework for building AI agents with powerful tools, sandbox execution, and multi-agent orchestration capabilities. Built on top of Strands SDK, the system is functional and ready for further development and enhancement.
