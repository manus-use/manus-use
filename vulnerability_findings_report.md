### Exploit Chain: CVE-2025-4427 + CVE-2025-4428

These vulnerabilities are particularly dangerous when used together in a chain attack:

1. **Step 1:** Exploit CVE-2025-4427 to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application
2. **Step 2:** Leverage CVE-2025-4428 to inject and execute arbitrary code via Server-Side Template Injection

This chain allows attackers to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution on affected Ivanti EPMM instances, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

## General Security Recommendations

1. **Patch Management**:
   - Implement a vulnerability management program to track and prioritize patching
   - Apply security patches as soon as they become available
   - Maintain an up-to-date asset inventory to ensure all systems are covered

2. **Network Security**:
   - Implement network segmentation to limit access to critical systems
   - Deploy firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems
   - Restrict access to management interfaces from untrusted networks

3. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Implement multi-factor authentication where possible
   - Follow the principle of least privilege for user accounts
   - Regularly audit user access and permissions

4. **Monitoring & Detection**:
   - Monitor systems for suspicious activities that might indicate exploitation attempts
   - Implement intrusion detection systems to identify potential attacks
   - Review logs regularly for signs of unauthorized access or unusual behavior

5. **Incident Response**:
   - Develop incident response procedures specific to different vulnerability types
   - Conduct regular security drills to test response capabilities
   - Maintain communication channels with security vendors for timely updates
